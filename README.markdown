# JavaScript Kōans (WIP)

A series of tests (kōans) to help developers explore their understanding of JavaScript.

## What are the kōans?
[Kōans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dan) (公案) originate from Zen Buddhism, and are paradoxical riddles or stories used to test "students" on their path to enlightenment. The kōans in this repository are small unit tests designed to help you deepen your understanding of JavaScript. The tests themselves are written in the Jasmine testing framework.

If you're familiar with testing, proceed to the ["Getting started"](#getting-started) section to learn how to use this repo.

If you're new to testing, you might want to read the ["What are tests?"](#what-are-tests) section.

## What are tests?
In software development, *tests* are programs that descibe how software should behave. They run key parts of the software in a variety of situations to verify that the software is working correctly. If the software doesn't work as the test expects, the test will fail. These failures help developers catch bugs before they end up in production software. On larger teams especially, testing helps developers feel confident about the stability of their software – they do not have to understand every part of a large code base to feel some confidence that their software is working correctly.

**No amount of testing can guarantee bug-free software**, but good tests are an essential part of any large-scale project.

### What's in a test?


## Getting started
To run these tests, clone this repository to your computer, then open the `index.html` file in your browser. You'll be presented with some information about failing tests, and you must edit those tests to make them pass.

Begin your journey in `00-about-expects.js`. The test files are numbered sequentially, and the tests themselves get progressively more complex. Each test will prompt you to examine your knowledge of JavaScript. Remember: it's okay if you don't know something! Take these tests as far as you can go, and from there, you can look up information to deepen your understanding.
